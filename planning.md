# Planning

- [ ] create wireframes using Inkscape
- [ ] define components on the wireframes
- [ ] define the component tree
- [ ] build static App (no interactivity)

## How to use wireframes

1. We're building our wireframes as SVGs in Inkscape
2. We're wrapping each SVG in a simple HTML page
3. If needed, we'll be adding buttons to the HTML files.

   a. A "Next" button will bring us to the next wireframe

   b. A "Follow 'XYZ'" will take us to the "XYZ" wireframe.

   c. etc.

0. If wee need it, wie will also create a Dashboard.

0. The most important rule: KISS &ndash; Keep It Simple, Stupid!
